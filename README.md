# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

The game comprises of two participants: the computer (house) and the user. It is divided into two sections, with the original section offering three choices, while the bonus section expands to five choices for selection. This particular project focuses solely on the five fundamental options: rock, paper, scissors, spock and lizard.

Upon reaching the start page, the user is presented with the five choices, while the computer employs a random selection. At the bottom of the page, a button is situated, containing the rules of the game. Clicking on any of the choices leads to a new page where the game unfolds.

In the event that the user emerges victorious, their score increases by one. Conversely, if the computer wins, the score decreases by one. In the case of a draw, neither an increase nor decrease in the score occurs. To engage in another round of play, a "Play Again" button is available, redirecting the user to the start page.
